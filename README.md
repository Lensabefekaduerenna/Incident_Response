<h2>Incident report analysis</h2>

In this project, I responded to a security incident, analyized the situation by following NIST-CSF framework for insident response. I also looked into NIST-800-61 (Incident Response framework), NIST-800-53 (Security Controls Framework) and NIST-800-37 (Risk Managment frameworks).
<h2>Summary of the incident</h2>
The company experienced a security event when all network services suddenly stopped responding. The cybersecurity team found the disruption was caused by a distributed denial of services (DDoS) attack through a flood of incoming ICMP packets. The team responded by blocking the attack and stopping all non-critical network services, so that critical network services could be restored.
